// Explanation:
// Here I have used Rest Parameter for taking variable number of arguments.
// In the code snippet â€¦restArgs creates an array restArgs that holds all the
// arguments passed to the function in an array. So basically it's like passing
// an array as an argument to a function. Since restArgs is an array I can apply
// array methods on it.
// Also here I've used reduce since we need to get a single value from the
// function which is related to the result of the previous iteration of the
// operation.
// So reduce takes an array then performs some operation on it and then returns
// a value as an argument to the next iteration until the last value is
// evaluated and returned.
